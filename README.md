## Digimon VPet as an API.
The idea for this project is to make a recreation of the digimon vpets made by bandai and disponibilize it as an API to be used in other project, making it as lightweight as possible so it can run on most devices

# TODO: How to build, collaborate, etc.
# All V-Pet sprites in this repo are provided by BladeSabre
